# Tester
This is only a fragment from a project, therefore it won't compile.

It was written as simple Java command line tool for performing experimental tests on specific system. As input it requires CSV file which contains test type, execution time and test data filename. Tool loads tests, executes on scheduled time and creates test result file. Tool supports paralel test execution.
